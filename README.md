# Telugu Word Prediction using N-gram Language Models

## 🔍 Abstract

Word prediction is a key feature in modern typing systems that significantly enhances typing efficiency, especially for users with disabilities. This project focuses on **Telugu word prediction** using statistical **N-gram Language Models** (unigram, bigram, trigram). By leveraging a large Telugu corpus, the model predicts the most likely next word based on the previous context, reducing keystrokes, misspellings, and typing time.
